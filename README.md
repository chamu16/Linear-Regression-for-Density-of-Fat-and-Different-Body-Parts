# Linear Regression for Density of Fat and Different Body Parts

## Introduction

The relationship between body density and various body measurements is crucial for understanding the distribution of body fat. This study explores the correlation between body density and body fat percentage, age, height, and measurements of different body parts.

## Objective

●	Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics of the variables.

●	Build a multiple linear regression model to predict body density based on the given predictors.

●	Assess the model's assumptions, such as linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals.

●	Interpret the regression coefficients and evaluate the model's performance.



### Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: The dataset for this project is obtained from a reliable source.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure that it is in a suitable format for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The dataset is analyzed to understand the distribution of variables.
4. **Model Selection**: The most suitable linear regression model is selected based on the data and the objectives of the analysis.
5. **Model Estimation**: The selected model is estimated using the dataset.
6. **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics such as R-squared.
7. **Model Interpretation**: The regression coefficients are interpreted to understand the relationship between the predictors and the target variable.
8. **Model Refining**: The model is refined by addressing any issues or limitations identified during the evaluation and interpretation stages.



## Result and Discussion

●	The multiple linear regression model explains a significant portion of the variance in body density (R-squared = 0.9555).

●	Body fat percentage is the most important predictor, with a highly significant negative coefficient (p < 0.001). A one-unit increase in body fat percentage is associated with a 0.002377 decrease in body density.

●	Other variables, such as age, height, and measurements of different body parts, do not have statistically significant coefficients in the model.

●	The model assumptions of linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals are reasonably met, indicating the validity of the regression results.

●	The findings suggest that body fat percentage is the primary determinant of body density among the variables considered in this study.
